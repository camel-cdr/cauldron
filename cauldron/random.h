 * 1. Introduction =============================================================
 *
 * Random number generators (RNGs) are an essential ingredient in the software
 * landscape, yet standard libraries of most languages only implement outdated
 * algorithms or don't implement them at all.
 * The following is the description and implementation of a C library which
 * implements the most important features for dealing with randomness.
 *
 * 1.1 Library structure -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Before we get into the code, let's quickly glance over the library structure:
 *     - We use tex math notation for more complex mathematical expressions.
 *       If you have trouble reading them just try using online tex engines
 *       like http://atomurl.net/math/.
 *     - The code from each chapter should be independent and could be
 *       copy-pasted into any other project.
 *     - We use the stb style for header only libraries, that is we only supply
 *       the implementation of non inline functions if RANDOM_H_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       is defined. This means that you must define RANDOM_H_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       in EXACTLY ONE C file before you include this header file:
 *           #define RANDOM_H_IMPLEMENTATION
 *           #include "random.h"
 *     - We'll also cast all conversions from void* manually, to obtain C++
 *       compatibility

 *       (This simplifies the assumptions for dist_normal(f)_zig later).
 *     - Everything else that isn't portable is guarded by ..._AVAILABLE macros.

 * 1.2 API overview ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * True random number generator:
 *     void trng_close(void)
 *     int trng_write(void *ptr, size_t n);
 *     int trng_write_notallzero(void *ptr, size_t n);

 *     uint32_t trng_u32(void *);
 *     uint64_t trng_u64(void *);
 *
 * Pseudorandom number generators:
 *     Every PRNGs implements a common generic interface for initialization
 *     and number generation,
 *         void NAME_randomize(void *rng); // randomly initializes rng
 *         uintXX_t NAME(void *rng); // returns next random number
 *     a generator specific one for explicit initialization (seeding)
 *         void NAME_init(TYPE *rng, [...]); // initialize rng with custom data
 *     and optionally a jump function.
 *         void NAME_jump(TYPE *rng, [...]); // skip multiple calls to the rng
 *
 *     The generators NAME is prefixed with the classification e.g.:
 *         void prng32_pcg_randomize(void *rng);
 *         uint32_t prng32_pcg(void *rng);

 *
 * 2. True random number generators ============================================
 *
 * We'll begin by implementing the backbone of every proper usage of random
 * number generation, true random number generators (TRNGs).
 * The output of TRNGs should be indistinguishable from "true randomness".
 * In contrast to pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), which solely rely
 * on a arithmetics, TRNGs sample from physical sources of randomness.
 * They utilize a combination of cryptographically secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs) and
 * high-quality entropy sources, which are very platform-specific.
 * Luckily most operating systems have a build in TRNG we can use:
 *     - RtlGenRandom() on windows
 *     - arc4random() on OpenBSD, CloudABI and WebAssembly
 *     - getrandom system call on FreeBSD and modern Linux kernels
 *     - /dev/urandom on other UNIX-like operating systems
 *
 * If none is available, which frequently happens in embedded systems,
 * TRNG_NOT_AVAILABLE will be defined. In such cases, one can use a CSPRNG in
 * combination with hardware entropy, although if you need secure cryptography
 * please consult an expert.

/*
 * 3. Pseudorandom number generator ============================================
 *
 * Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) deterministically generate numbers
 * whose properties approximate those of "true random numbers".
 * They work by utilizing initial "true random numbers" to arithmetically
 * generate new random-looking (pseudorandom) numbers, which makes that PRNGs,
 * in contrast to TRNGs, deterministic. The same initialization (seeding) will
 * result in the generation of the same sequence of numbers. This can be quite
 * practical for uses in simulations, games and many other use cases.
 * Furthermore, PRNGs are way faster and more memory efficient than TRNGs.
 *
 * But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's consider the following PRNG you
 * can trivially compute using mental arithmetics <1>:
 *     1. Select an initial random number (seed) between 1 and 58.
 *        (This is accomplished by mentally collecting entropy from the
 *         environment, e.g. counting a group of objects)
 *     2. Multiply the least significant digit by 6, add the most significant
 *        digit and use the result as the next seed/state.
 *     3. The second digit of the state is your generated pseudorandom number.
 *     4. Goto 2.
 *                            Sequence generated by 42:
 *   42|16|37|45|34|27|44|28|50|05|03|18|49|58|53|23|20|02|12|13|19|55|35|33|21
 *    2| 6| 7| 5| 4| 7| 4| 8| 0| 5| 3| 8| 9| 8| 3| 3| 0| 2| 2| 3| 9| 5| 5| 3| 1
 *
 * While these numbers certainly look pretty random for humans, they won't be
 * sufficient for simulation purposes and are easily predictable.
 * Not to mention, that the generated sequence repeats after only 58
 * generated numbers. Note that this is not a uniform PRNG, because the digits
 * 9 and 0 are slightly less likely to be generated, because 58 doesn't divide
 * evenly into 10. We call, how many numbers a PRNG can generate before it
 * repeats, the period.
 *
 * The period must be big enough to generate no overlapping sequences.
 * For n sequences of length L given a generator of period P, we can approximate
 * the probability with the formula p <= L*(n^2)/P. <2>
 * For most purposes, you want a period of at least 2^{64} and for parallel
 * applications, anything in the ballpark of 2^{128} should be sufficient.
 *
 * Other than that the quality of the generated randomness is equally essential.
 * Sadly no mathematical proof of randomness exists, therefore we need to use
 * empirical statistic analysis test suites like TestU01 <3> and PractRand <4>.
 *
 * There are many different PRNGs with various periods, qualities, speeds and
 * memory footprints of which we need to strike a balance.
 * We'll be implementing three families of generators (and discus a forth one)
 * which pass all tests of PractRand and TestU01 (xoshiro/xoroshiro's + variants
 * fail linear testing) and vary in security, speed and portability.
 * This is a crude overview of the featured generators, more detail is available
 * in the subsequent chapters:
 *
 * Permuted Congruential Generator (PCG) family <5>:
 *     Advantages:
 *         - Very high quality
 *         - Jump ahead support
 *         - Independent streams
 *         - Hard to reverse (though by no means cryptographic <6>)
 *     Disadvantages:
 *         - Not as fast as the other PRNGs
 *         - 32/64-bit variant requires 64/128-bit arithmetic
 *             -> not as portable
 *             -> generating 64-bit numbers using a 32-bit PCG is even slower
 *
 * Rotate-multiply (Romu) family <7>:
 *     Advantages:
 *         - Very high quality
 *         - Very very fast
 *     Disadvantages:
 *         - The period varies in length (although the probabilities of small
 *           periods are known and very very low)
 *         - New and not yet extensively tested/reviewed in the scientific
 *           literature (as of 2021)
 *
 * xoshiro/xoroshiro family <8>:
 *     Advantages:
 *         - Very high quality (except the + variety)
 *         - Very fast
 *         - Jump ahead support
 *     Disadvantages:
 *         - The + variety fails linear tests
 *         - Some issues escaping zero land
 *           (when only a few bits of the state are set)
 *
 * Middle Square Weyl Sequence (MSWS) generator <10>:
 *     Advantages:
 *         - Very high quality
 *         - Independent streams
 *         - Easy to memorize implementation
 *     Disadvantages:
 *         - Not as fast as the other PRNGs
 *         - 32/64-bit variant requires 64/128-bit arithmetic
 *             -> not as portable
 *             -> generating 64-bit numbers using a 32-bit PCG is even slower
 *
 * For a performance comparison check out the benchmark at tools/random/bench.c.
 * The tools to test the quality of the PRNGs are also available in
 * tools/random (e.g. ./rng prng64_romu_quad | ./PractRand stdin64).
 */

/*
 * 3.1 Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs) ---------------------------------
 *
 * Permuted congruential generators (PCGs) <5> improve upon the statistical
 * properties of linear congruential generators (LCGs) by using a state twice as
 * large as the output and applying a transformation/permutation, which
 * results in excellent statistical properties. Sadly this sacrifices either
 * performance or portability, as you require a type twice as large as the
 * output (generating 64-bit integers require a 128-bit integer type).
 * The LCG nature of PCGs allows for arbitrary jump ahead and the application of
 * different streams.
 *
 * LCGs are one of the oldest and best-known PRNGs and have the format:
 *     state := (a * state + c) \mod m
 * The following conditions must be satisfied by 'a' and 'c', to obtain the
 * maximal period length 'm':
 *     - 'c' is coprime to 'm'
 *     - a-1 is divisible by all prime factors of 'm'
 *     - a-1 is divisible by 4 if 'm' is divisible by 4
 * If we use the two to the power of bits in our state variable as the modulo,
 * unsigned integer overflow will automatically apply the effect of modulo and
 * lets us omit the expensive instruction. Now it's trivial to find suitable
 * values for 'c' because every smaller odd number is coprime to a power-of-two.
 * We'll use this to implement different streams for our PCG generators.
 *
 * Values for 'a', with good statistical properties, can be determined using the
 * spectral test though the specifics are out of scope for this document.
 *
 * We can derive a jump ahead equation by simplifying multiple applications of
 * the LCG.
 * Two applications
 *     state := (a * (a * state + c) + c) \mod m
 * can be simplified to
 *     state := (a^2 * state + c * (a + 1)) \mod m.
 * To jump ahead n applications
 *     state := (a*(a*(...(a * state + c)...)+c)+c) \mod m
 * simplifies to
 *     state := (a^n * state + c * (\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i)) \mod m.
 * Further simpifying, using the formula
 *     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i = (a^n - 1)/(a - 1),
 * yields the final simplification
 *     state := (a^n * state + c * (a^n - 1)/(a - 1)) \mod m.
 *
 * Vanilla LCGs perform quite poorly at small state sizes, but rapidly improve
 * with bigger state sizes. The problem with power-of-2 LCGs is that the
 * lower-order bits have more regularities. To overcome this problem PCGs
 * apply a variable rotate permutation to the generated output.

/*
 * 3.2 Romu PRNGs --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Rotate-multiply (Romu) PRNGs <7> combine the linear operation of
 * multiplication with the nonlinear rotations.
 *
 * The rotation constants were devised empirically by testing scaled-down
 * generators with less state against PractRand. The best of these constants
 * were then scale up for use in the full-size generators.
 * The multipliers are handcrafted, making sure that they have an irregular
 * bit-pattern. A similar technique is employed by B. Widynski's Middle Square
 * Weyl Sequence PRNG to obtain several independent streams. <10>
 * The duo, trio and quad variants each use 2, 3 and 4 state variables, on
 * which the operations above and extra additions and subtractions, are
 * applied. The nature of these operations dictates that the state can't have
 * every bit set to zero, which mustn't be forgotten when initializing a
 * generator.
 *
 * One can estimate the capacity of the full-sized generators, by running a
 * scaled-down version through statistical testing until it fails. This
 * theoretically means that the generators won't fail until they have
 * generated more than their capacity specifies using a particular seed.
 *
 * The incredible speed of the Romu generators is due to it being optimized
 * with instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in mind. ILP is used in most modern
 * processors and allows the execution of multiple instructions in each clock
 * cycle whenever possible. Most x86 CPUs can execute up to four instructions
 * in each clock cycle. Always leaving one instruction slot per cycle free to
 * be used by the surrounding application code, allows the inlined Romu
 * generators to introduce almost no delay for the application.
 *
 * As mentioned above Romu PRNGs are nonlinear, which means that they don't
 * have a single cycle that goes through the while period, but rather multiple
 * ones with various periods. One must be exceedingly cautious with nonlinear
 * generators, because of the likely hood to encounter short cycles. The
 * probabilities of such are fortunately known and very low. The upper bound
 * probability of periods shorter than 2^k is calculated, given a state
 * size of 2^s-1, with 2^{k-s+7}.
 *
 * We can't follow our already established formula to calculate the probability
 * of overlapping sequences. Fortunately, this was also addressed in the Romu
 * paper. For n sequences of length 2^L given s bits of state in the generator,
 * we can approximate the probability with the formula
 *     p <= 2^{6.5+l-s}(s-l+1)(n-1)n.
 *
 * Recommendations:
 *     - duo_jr/duo for all-out speed
 *     - trio as the default
 *     - quad for large scale parallel applications

 * possess better statistical properties than vanilla LCGs they nevertheless
 * fail many statistical tests.
 *
 * Linearity tests specifically are impossible to be passd by vanilla LFSRs,
 * hence, similar to the PCGs generators the output must be scrambled. This is
 * frequently achieved by using various additions or multiplications.
 *
 * The xoshiro/xoroshiro generators <8> featured here additionally incorporate
 * bit rotations, which improve the state diffusion, as no bit of the operand is
 * discarded. We'll be implementing two different scramblers, a faster one with
 * a weaker scramble (s/p i.e. '*'/'+') and a slower one with a stronger
 * scramble (ss/pp i.e. '**'/'++'). It's recommended to use the s/p variants for
 * generating floating-point numbers.

 * 3.4 Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNGs ---------------------------------------
 *
 * The Middle Square Weyl Sequence (MSWS) PRNG is an improved version of the
 * first ever PRNG, the middle square method invented by John von Neumann.
 * The original had a big problem with short periods, to circumvent this issue
 * Widynski <10> proposed combining it with a Weyl sequence.
 *
 * A Weyl sequence is constructed by continuously adding a constant 'c' to our
 * state with the modulo of 'm':
 *      state := state + c \mod m
 * This will give us a full period of [0;m) for every value 'c' that is coprime
 * to 'm'.
 * The resulting sequence of numbers isn't very random, but can be used in
 * combination with the way more random middle square method to guarantee
 * full cycles.
 *
 * The MSWS generators are about as fast as the PCG generators and also have
 * excellent statistical properties. However this library doesn't implement it
 * directly, because the other PRNGs cover most use-cases already and because it
 * has a very simple structure.
 * So simple in fact, that you can memorize it compleatly. It only uses three
 * instructions and doesn't require you to memorize any fancy constants,
 * only three rules to create arbitrary constants:
 *     x *= x;                    // square x
 *     x += (w += s);             // advance the Weyl sequence and add it to x
 *     x = (x >> 32) | (x << 32); // swap upper and lower bits (rotate)
 * Where s is a randomly chosen stream, which should have an irregular bit-
 * pattern you can manually create by following three easy rules:
 *      1. The constant must be odd.
 *      2. Every 4-bytes should have unique nibbles within these 4-bytes.
 *      3. No nibble shall equal zero.
 * E.g.: uint32_t s = 0x9F32E1CA; or uint64_t s = 0xB5AD4ECEDA1CE2A9;
 *
 * It suffers from the same problem as the PCG generators, you require an
 * internal type twice as large as the output type.
 * Though it's fast enough that you could just combine two consecutive outputs
 * or distinct generators to subvert this limitation.
 *
 * Period: Full size of x
 * BigCrush: Passes
 * PractRand: Passes (TODO)

/*
 * 4. Cryptographically secure PRNGs ===========================================
 *
 * Cryptographically secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs), while behaving deterministically,
 * are designed to be impossible for an outside observer to predict or reverse.
 * This is accomplished using mathematical constructs that guarantee, that there
 * is no polynomial-time algorithm that could predict the subsequent bit with a
 * better than 50% probability. Moreover, CSPRNGs should be resistant to state
 * compromises, i.e. it should be impossible to reconstruct the state even if
 * fragments of it were compromised. Many cryptographic applications of CSPRNGs
 * additionally require a constant execution time, which, if not guaranteed,
 * could leak information on the internal state.
 * The CSPRNG implementation presented bellow should satisfy the aforementioned
 * requirements, though I'm uncertain about the constant execution time.
 *
 * If you need cryptographic security, make sure to consult an expert!!!

 * 5. Random distributions =====================================================
 *

 * We might want to generate random numbers in a specific range or under a
 * specific probability distribution.
 *
 * We implement functions to generate unbiased random numbers in ranges and
 * functions to generate normal distributions.
 */

/*
 * 5.1 Uniform integer distribution --------------------------------------------
 *
 * Let's tackle this with a quick example. Suppose we had a 4-bit RNG and want
 * to simulate dice rolls, how hard could it be?
 *
 * A widespread misconception is that one can just take the modulus:
 *     x = rand4() % 6 + 1;
 * But that doesn't add up, does it?
 *     Possible RNG output:     0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7   Histogram: 2|2|1|1|1|1
 *     Corresponding dice roll: 1|2|3|4|5|6|1|2              1|2|3|4|5|6
 *
 * Another only marginally better approach is to convert to and from floating-
 * point numbers:
 *     x = (int)(rand4() / 8.0 * 6.0) + 1;
 * This method spreads out the bias across the range, so it's less noticeable.
 *     Possible RNG output:     0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7   Histogram: 2|1|1|2|1|1
 *     Corresponding dice roll: 1|1|2|3|4|4|5|6              1|2|3|4|5|6
 * For this to work as expected, the floating-point type must have a mantissa
 * with at least as many bits as the generator generates. This requires the use
 * of long double for 64-bit numbers and specific knowledge about the platform.
 *
 * While these approaches are biased, you might still want to use them and trade
 * correctness for performance. Though many use-cases, like simulations or
 * cryptography, demand unbiased uniform integer distributions.
 *
 * The easiest way to achieve such an unbiased distribution is to just choose a
 * power-of-two range and bitmask the relevant bits. This should be used
 * whenever possible and preferably implemented using the bit and '&' operator
 * instead of the modulo operator '%', to document that this was on purpose and
 * not an accidentally unbiased case of the biased method.
 *
 * We can generalize the above approach by just dropping numbers that don't fit
 * into the range. In our dice example above we'd just call the RNG again if
 * the value is greater than 6:
 *     while ((x = rand4() + 1) > 6);
 *
 * We run into problems if the differences between the generators and our range
 * is large. A better apoach than restricting the generated size is to drop out
 * all of the biased states. This is achieved by calculating the number of
 * overrepesented digits and skipping any generated numbers that are smaller
 * than the count of those digits.
 *     uint32_t x, r = (-range) % range; // equivalent to '2^{32} \mod range'
 *     do x = rng(); while (x < r);
 *     return r % range;
 *
 * By removing the top part of the engine's range one can improve the algorithm
 * further, so that the expensive modulo operation is called less often: */

/*
 * 5.2 Uniform real distribution -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Generating uniform random floating-point numbers might seem easy at first
 * glance, just cast the output of a PRNG to the desired float type and divide
 * it by the biggest possible output of the PRNG to obtain a random float
 * between 0 and 1 that can now be scaled up.
 * Though as before this straightforward approach is biased.
 *
 * For the next part, I assume you are already acquainted with the IEEE 754
 * floating-point standard <12>, we will not cover other formats.
 *
 * To recap, here is a quick reminder on how 32-bit floats are laid out in
 * memory:
 *
 *     sign  exponent           fraction
 *     +/-  bias: -126
 *     [X]  [XXXXXXXX]  [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]
 *
 * The interpretation of the data is dependant on the value of the exponent:
 *
 *     If 0 < exp < 255:
 *         +/- 1.fraction * 2^{exponent - 126}
 *     If exp = 0 (demormalized):
 *         +/- 0.fraction * 2^{-126}
 *     If exp = 255:
 *         If fraction = 0:
 *             >+/- inf
 *         If fraction != 0:
 *             NaN
 *
 * Note that the 1/0.fraction part is also called the mantissa.
 *
 * The varying exponent allows floating-point numbers to represent a huge range
 * of values. What makes random float generation tricky is the fact that the
 * amount of numbers less than 1 and greater than 1 is the same. This means that
 * we can't just divide a random integer among these values without getting
 * duplicates and omissions <13>:
 *
 *    Integer: |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
 *             |    |    /    |   /    /    /    /      \ __/    \ __/     |
 *    Float:   ||||-|-|-|--|--|--|----|----|----|--------|--------|--------|
 *
 * There are multiple ways to subvert this problem.
 *
 * You can use the division method described above with a divider that
 * guarantees equal spacing between generated floating-point numbers.
 * This is less biased, but can't generate all possible representable values
 * between 0 and 1 and can lose equal spacing when scaling up a specific range.
 * Nevertheless, this is a good tradeoff between speed and accuracy.

 * Another solution is to generate every representable floating-point number
 * with a probability proportional to the covered real number range. <14>

 *
 * This property is obtained by randomizing the fraction uniformly and
 * randomizing the exponent, with the probability 2^{-x} for every possible
 * exponent 'x'.
 * This can be achieved programmatically by generating random bits and
 * decrementing the maximal exponent until one of the generated bits is set,
 * thus halving the probability of the next decrement every time.
 * Finally, we need to reject all values that are outside of the desired range.
 *
 * Before we go into the implementation, let's compare the quality of generated
 * floating-point numbers between dist_uniformf and dist_uniformf_dense:
 *
 * The difference in the expected probability and the empirical result of a
 * random floating-point in [r1,r2] also being inside [s1,s2] are plotted in the
 * histograms below.
 * Here [r1,r2] was randomly choosen inside [-10^{-6},10^{-6}] and [s1,s2]
 * randomly choosen inside [r1,r2].
 * Then random floats between 0 and 1 were generated using dist_uniformf and
 * dist_uniformf_dense and rejected if they weren't inside [r1,r2].
 * From those that get through, we count the probability of them also being
 * inside [s1,s2] and plott (P(expected)-P(empirical))/P(expected),
 * with the expected probability calculated as described above.
 * The rejection process is necessary to expose the defects in dist_uniformf,
 * as they only show up in the smaller subranges.
 * With larger ranges (e.g. [r1=-0.1,r2=0.1]) the two plots are equally normal
 * distributed.

 * 'm' is a power-of-two, as only one bit is set, hence a multiplication with

 * 5.3 Normal real distribution ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * One of the fastest algorithms for generating normally distributed random
 * numbers is the ziggurat method <16><17>. It uses a lookup table and thus
 * requires a somewhat large amount of memory.
 * As this might not meet everybodie's needs we also implement the ratio method
 * <18><19>, which doesn't require any internal state and is a bit slower.
 *
 * The more popular polar method might be faster than the ratio method (though
 * not the ziggurat method), but generates two values at a time.
 * We'd need to discard one of these values as our function shouldn't have any
 * state, hence the ratio method is faster in our use case.
 *     polar method: 660 ns (without discarding the second number: 330ns)
 *     ratio method: 368 ns
 *     <https://github.com/ampl/gsl/blob/master/randist/gauss.c>
 */

/*
 * 5.3.1 Ratio method ..........................................................
 *
 * The ration method uses the fact that the ratio of a pair of random variables
 * (u,v) uniformaly distributed over
 *     C_f = \{(u,v): 0 <= u <= \sqrt{f(v/u)}\}
 * yields a random variable X=(v/u) with the density f. <18>
 *
 * If we apply this to the normal distribution f(x) = \exp(-(v^2)/2)
 * then u <= \sqrt{\exp(-((v/u)^2)/2)} = \exp(-(v^2)/(4u^2))
 * and v_{1,2} <= +/- 2u\sqrt{-\ln(u)} or in a more easily computable format
 * v^2 <= -4u^2\ln(u).
 *
 * To obtain (u,v) uniformaly over C_f, we'll use a acception-rejection method,
 * similar to the one used in dist_UNIFORM_INT. We generate (u,v) uniformly in
 * the bounding box B = \{ 0 < u < 1; -\sqrt(2/e) < v < \sqrt(2/e) \} of C_f
 * and reject everything that isn't inside of C_f (if v^2 > -4u^2\ln u).
 *
 * As computing the natural log is rather expensive, Leva <19> proposed a set of
 * quadratic bounding curves that drastically decrease the calls to \ln:
 *             r_2 < Q(u,v) = (u-s)^2 - b(u-s)(v+t) + a(u-t)^2 < r_1
 *                      s=0.449871  a=0.19600   t=0.386595
